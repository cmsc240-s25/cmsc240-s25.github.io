# Project Presentation 

## Presentation Objective
The project presentation is an essential component of the C++ REST API project. It allows teams to showcase the depth, complexity, and functionality of your work. The presentation should concisely cover the project's design, implementation, testing, and include a demonstration of the working API.

## Presentation Guidelines

- **Length**: 8 minutes, followed by a 2-minute Q&A session.
- **Content**:
  - **Introduction (1 minute)**: Briefly introduce your team and the REST API project's concept.
  - **Design (2 minutes)**: Describe the API's design, including the main resources, endpoints, and any unique design decisions. Highlight parts of your UML diagrams that played a crucial role.
  - **Implementation (2 minutes)**: Discuss key aspects of your implementation. Highlight the use of C++ features such as classes, inheritance, composition, and templates. Discuss any challenges and how they were overcome.
  - **Testing (1 minute)**: Summarize your testing approach, covering the unit testing framework used, test coverage, and any notable findings or challenges.
  - **API Demonstration (2 minutes)**: Provide a quick demonstration of the API. Show a few key operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.
- **Q&A Session (2 minutes)**: Be prepared to answer questions regarding your project, choices made, and technical challenges encountered.
