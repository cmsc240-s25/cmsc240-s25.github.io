## Practice Questions <a class="anchor" id="practice"></a>

### Access Specifiers (public, private, protected)

__Book.cpp__
```c++
class Book {
public:
    Book(std::string t) : title(t) {}

    std::string getTitle() const {
        return title;
    }

    void summarize() {
        std::cout << "This is a book titled: " << title << std::endl;
    }

protected:
    std::string title;
};

class Novel : public Book {
public:
    Novel(std::string t, std::string g) : Book(t), genre(g) {}

    void summarize() {
        std::cout << "This is a " << genre << " novel titled: " << title << std::endl;
    }

private:
    std::string genre;
};

int main()
{
    Novel mystery{"A Study in Scarlet", "Mystery"};

    // Can you do this?
    std::cout << mystery.title << std::endl; 

    return 0;
}
```

Consider the C++ program __Book.cpp__ above.
* Describe the purpose of the `protected` access specifier in the `Book` class, and explain how it contrasts with the `private` access specifier.
* In the `Novel` class, which inherits from `Book`, can the summarize method directly access the `title` attribute? Provide a justification for your answer.
* If you create an object (instance) of the `Novel` class within the `main` function, can you directly access the `title` attribute from that object? Elaborate on your answer.


### Dynamic Memory Allocation and Deallocation

__Particle.cpp__
```c++
class Particle {
public:
    Particle(float x, float y) : posX(x), posY(y) {}

    void move(float dx, float dy) {
        posX += dx;
        posY += dy;
    }

    void printPosition() const {
        std::cout << "Position: (" << posX << ", " << posY << ")" << std::endl;
    }

private:
    float posX, posY;
};

int main() {
    Particle* p1 = new Particle(5.0, 7.5);
    p1->move(2.0, -3.0);
    p1->printPosition();

    // Some code here...

    return 0;
}
```
Consider the C++ program __Particle.cpp__ above.
* What does the `new` keyword do in the main function?
* What is returned from the expression `new Particle(5.0, 7.5)`?
* As the code stands, there's a potential issue related to dynamic memory management. Identify the issue and explain why it's problematic.
* Provide a modification to the code to fix the potential memory management issue you identified.


### Polymorphism and Virtual Functions

__Media.cpp__
```c++
class MultimediaContent {
public:
    virtual void play() {
        std::cout << "Playing generic multimedia content." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Song : public MultimediaContent {
public:
    void play() {
        std::cout << "Playing a melodious song." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Video : public MultimediaContent {
public:
    void play() {
        std::cout << "Streaming a captivating video." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MultimediaContent* content1 = new Song();
    MultimediaContent* content2 = new Video();

    content1->play();  // ?
    content2->play();  // ?

    delete content1;
    delete content2;
    
    return 0;
}
```
Consider the C++ program __Media.cpp__ above.
* What is the significance of the `virtual` keyword in the `MultimediaContent` class regarding the `play` method?
* Given the `main` function provided, what will the output be when the program is executed?
* Describe what is meant by the term `polymorphism` in the context of the provided code.


### Implementing the constructor and methods of a class

Consider the following C++ code in the file `Calculator.h`.


```c++
#ifndef CALCULATOR_H
#define CALCULATOR_H

class Calculator {
public:
    // Constructor: Initializes the calculator with a given value.
    Calculator(double initialValue);

    // Adds a value to the current result.
    void add(double value);

    // Subtracts a value from the current result.
    void subtract(double value);

    // Multiplies the current result by a given value.
    void multiply(double value);

    // Divides the current result by a given value. If the given value is zero, do nothing.
    void divide(double value);

    // Returns the current result.
    double getResult() const;

private:
    double result;
};

#endif
```

Use the C++ code above to answer the following questions.

* Write the C++ code that you would put into the file `Calculator.cpp` to implement the constructor and methods for the `Calculator` class found in `Calculator.h`. Do your best to write code that will compile. Remember to use `#include` as needed for external libraries or the `Calculator.h` file.

* Draw a __UML__ diagram that represents the `Calculator` class. Remember to include the name of the class, the member variables (attributes) and their type, and member functions (methods) and their return and parameter types. You should include the access specifiers for each attribute and method. If an attribute or method is `public` indicate this with a `+` sign. If an attribute or method is `private` indicate this with a `-` sign.
